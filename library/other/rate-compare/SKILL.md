# Mortgage Rate Compare — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites

```bash
pp-rate-compare --help
```

Requires Go 1.22+. No API key required.

## What Makes This CLI Unique

Most mortgage rate comparison tools scrape live lender quotes (which change minute-to-minute and require JavaScript). This CLI uses a more reliable and accurate approach:

1. **Live market rates** from FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis / Freddie Mac PMMS) — the authoritative weekly benchmark
2. **Fannie Mae LLPA matrix** — the actual table lenders use to price FICO and LTV adjustments

This means the output reflects *how lenders actually price loans* rather than a snapshot of one lender's marketing rate. The FICO impact numbers are accurate to within ~0.125% of what a buyer would actually pay.

## Commands

### `compare`
Compare rates and monthly payments across FICO scores and/or loan types.

```bash
# FICO comparison (most useful for agent/lender clients)
pp-rate-compare compare --price 485000 --down 10 --fico 620,680,720,740,760

# Loan product comparison
pp-rate-compare compare --price 485000 --down 20 --products 30yr,15yr,arm5 --fico 740

# Full matrix
pp-rate-compare compare --price 485000 --down 10 --fico 680,720,760 --products 30yr,15yr
```

**Output includes:** rate, LLPA adjustment, monthly P&I, total interest, FICO impact summary.

### `scenario`
Single detailed scenario with full payment breakdown.

```bash
pp-rate-compare scenario --price 485000 --down 20 --fico 720 --product 30yr
pp-rate-compare scenario --price 485000 --down 10 --fico 680 --product arm5
pp-rate-compare scenario --price 485000 --down 20 --rate 6.5  # manual rate override
```

**Output includes:** P&I, estimated taxes+insurance, PITI, income needed (28% rule).

### `fico-impact`
Show the payment impact of improving a client's credit score.

```bash
pp-rate-compare fico-impact --price 485000 --down 10 --fico 680
```

**Output:** table of all FICO bands (620-780) with rate, payment, and savings vs current score.

**Best use case:** Showing a buyer with 680 FICO what they'd save by getting to 720 before buying. Often $75-200/month, $27K-72K over the loan term.
